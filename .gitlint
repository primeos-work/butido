[general]
# Make body messages optional:
ignore=body-is-missing
# At this time, regex-style-search is disabled by default, but it will be
# enabled by default in the future. We already enable it here to avoid a
# warning message (our regular expressions are compatible with re.search()):
regex-style-search=true
# Don't ignore temporary commits (they can be useful for drafts but we shall
# not accidentally merge them (this is mainly important for our CI checks)):
ignore-fixup-commits=false
ignore-fixup-amend-commits=false
ignore-squash-commits=false

# Enable community contributed rules
# See http://jorisroovers.github.io/gitlint/contrib_rules for details

[ignore-by-author-name]

# Match commits made by dependabot:
