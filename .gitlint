[general]
# Make body messages optional:
ignore=body-is-missing
# At this time, regex-style-search is disabled by default, but it will be
# enabled by default in the future. We already enable it here to avoid a
# warning message (our regular expressions are compatible with re.search()):
regex-style-search=true

# Enable community contributed rules
# See http://jorisroovers.github.io/gitlint/contrib_rules for details
contrib=contrib-body-requires-signed-off-by

[ignore-by-author-name]
# Ignore certain rules for commits of which the author name matches a regex
# Match commits made by dependabot:
regex=(.*)dependabot(.*)
